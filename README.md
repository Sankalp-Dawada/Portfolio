## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-ai.git
cd portfolio-ai
```

### 2. Set Up Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file (or update existing):

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 3. Run Backend Server

```bash
node server.js
```

> Your API will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. Open Frontend

Use **Live Server (VS Code extension)** or open `index.html` directly in your browser.

### 5. Login to Admin Panel

- Navigate to the Login page using the navbar
- Use your admin credentials (set up in Firebase)
- After logging in, you'll have access to the project management panel

## ‚ú® How It Works

1. **Authentication**:
   - Admin credentials are securely stored in Firebase
   - Login state is managed via localStorage for simplicity

2. **Adding Projects**:
   - Fill in the **Add Project** form with a title, project file, and optional image
   - On submission, the file is uploaded to the backend
   - Backend reads the file and sends it to Gemini AI
   - Gemini returns a project description
   - The project data is saved to localStorage and displayed on the main page

3. **Project Management**:
   - Projects can be deleted, which removes both the data and associated files
   - Projects persist across sessions via localStorage

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Projects can be filtered in real-time using the search bar

## ü§ñ Using Gemini API

The application uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model to automatically generate project descriptions. When a file is uploaded, the content is sent to the Gemini API, which returns a concise 3-4 sentence description perfect for a portfolio showcase.

If the API call fails, the system falls back to a basic description based on file type and content length.

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Login/Logout Issues:**
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Ensure Firebase configuration is correct

**Gemini API Errors:**
- Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient permissions
- Check that the model name is current (currently using "gemini-1.5-pro")

**File Upload Issues:**
- Check that the upload directory has proper write permissions
- Verify file size limits in the multer configuration
